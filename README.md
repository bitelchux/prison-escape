# Prison Escape
This is my entry for the 2016 edition of [js13kGames compo](http://js13kgames.com/), a JavaScript coding competition
for HTML5 Game Developers where the file size limit is set to a maximum of 13 kb (13312 bytes) and no external 
libraries are allowed.

The theme for 2016 edition is **Glitch**. The actual size of my game is **11.87 kb (11873 bytes)** and it took me 
**37 hours 42 min** to complete.

A glitch in a prison complex could be something terrible, and it's up to you to take advantage of those glitches to 
escape. Avoid the cops, collect the coins and use the power ups to run the 1 km that separates you from freedom.

Best experienced on Chrome and Firefox. Run on Internet Explorer under your own risk ;)
